    <h1>Hi, Im Charis Alfan Maulana</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio, below you can explore some of my recent projects and skill demonstration. I'm currently seeking opportunities in these field. Please feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries or questions.</p>
    <h2>Selected Work</h2>
        <h3>IT Tech Support</h3>
            <h3>Storage Upgrade HP 245 G8</h3>
                <p>User complains that 256GB storage isn't enough but doesn't want to change the original NVME drive since it's way over the budget. Unfortunately it doesn't come with SATA cable or bracket. As a workaround, I've installed a new 256GB SATA drive using bracket and cable from HP 14s since both are compatible. Storage capacity up by 100% but cost down to about 60% since SATA drive are about half the price of NVMe drive.
